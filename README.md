# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Install Pods and Start the Metro Server

We need to install **node_module** dependencies and ios **CocoaPods**

```bash
# install node dependencies
npm i

# using yarn
yarn

# install pods with npx
npx pod-install

# or go to ./ios/
pod install
```

Then, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android (emulator or connected device)

To check if your computer detects Android device, type `adb devices` and you should see your phone and its ID

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

Keep in mind you need to set a valid Developer team/account in Xcode before you can run the app

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Run tests

Tests are run with jest and @testing-library for React Native

```bash
# install node dependencies
npm run test

#using yarn
yarn test
```
